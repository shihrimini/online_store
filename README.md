# online_store
This is one of my projects in C++ course. 
It simulates how an online store works.

There are three classes representing product, customer and store.
A store could have several products and customers.
A customer could add product to his/her cart if it's not out of stock.
A customer could check out items in his/her cart as long as they are still available,
since it's possible any other customer might check out the same items before him/her.
